## About

At Stackmate, we build software to enable self-sovereignty. We are and will always only ever be managed by Bitcoin remnants.

Our software is free from VC, fiat or shitcoin influences and we actively work to ward off such attempts.

All our software is FOSS. Feel free to do as you please with it.

## Goals

We aim to achieve:

1. Simplicity
2. Safety
3. Speed

Prioritized in that order.

## Core

This app uses [stackmate-core](https://github.com/i5hi/stackmate-core) for it's Bitcoin specific logic.
<br/>
[stackmate-core](https://github.com/i5hi/stackmate-core) is built using Rust.
<br/>
This app communicates with [stackmate-core's](https://github.com/i5hi/stackmate-core) Rust binary via FFI.

## Features

- **Descriptors** uses descriptor wallet specifications for simplicity in development and compatability in recovery
- **PSBT** uses psbt specifications to support watch-only wallets and compatability with hardware wallets
- **Taproot** supports taproot for single-sig to improve the overall anonymity set of bitcoin transactions
- **Cross Platform:** built using Flutter ðŸ’™ and Rust, allowing easy extension to multiple platforms
